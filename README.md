Project Overview
TaskFlow aims to revolutionize task management by offering a customizable and user-friendly experience. Unlike traditional to-do list apps that follow rigid structures, TaskFlow focuses on flexibility, allowing users to organize their tasks according to categories such as work, school, or personal matters. This ensures that no two dashboards look the same, providing a tailored experience for each user.

The app's design emphasizes personalization, discoverability, and intuitive interactions. Through features like color-coded categories and drag-and-drop functionality, users can organize tasks with minimal effort while receiving meaningful feedback from the system.

Features

Task Categorization: Sort tasks into categories such as work, school, or personal to keep everything organized.
Color-Coded Categories: Visual cues that make it easy to identify and differentiate between tasks.
Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Reorganize tasks effortlessly by dragging and dropping them within the dashboard.
Real-Time Feedback: Receive instant feedback when tasks are completed or modified.
Clean and Accessible Design: The interface is designed for maximum usability, allowing both novice and experienced users to navigate with ease.

Key Design Principles
1. Affordances and Discoverability
TaskFlow’s interface is built with affordances that help users easily understand what actions they can take. Clear visual cues, such as color-coded categories and draggable elements, provide intuitive interactions and immediate feedback.

2. User-Centered Customization
The dashboard design reflects each user's unique needs. This ensures that users can create their conceptual models for interacting with the app, making it easy to stay organized and efficient.
